        Javascript is a programming language used to give websites an interactive component.
        You can write a static site with only html, but for the most part it won't be able to
        interact with the user. If you interacted with the MYR website, you can see the several
        ways you can interact with it. You can write code that generates shapes and objects in
        the 3D environment, or use your keyboard to move around in the 3D environment, Most of
        MYR is written with javascript, and is arguably one of the most important thing to work
        with before you start working on MYR. W3Schools also has a great tutorial for
        familiarizing yourself with javascript that can be found here:
