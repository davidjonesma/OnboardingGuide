        All websites use HTML and its used to define the structure of the website.
        As myr used html, it's important to understand the very basics. A good website
        you can use for teaching yourself the basics of html is through W3 schools, here is a link
        to their free html tutorial to help you get the basics:

        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> stands for Cascading Style Sheets, while html is used to structure a website,
        CSS is used to styalize it and make it presentable. websites don't need CSS but
        many do, including MYR, so it's important to understand the basics of it too understand MYR.
        W3School's also has a lengthy tutorial on CSS, that can be found here:

        JAVASCRIPT

    <p>
        Javascript is a programming language used to give websites an interactive component.
        You can write a static site with only html, but for the most part it won't be able to
        interact with the user. If you interacted with the MYR website, you can see the several
        ways you can interact with it. You can write code that generates shapes and objects in
        the 3D environment, or use your keyboard to move around in the 3D environment, Most of
        MYR is written with javascript, and is arguably one of the most important thing to work
        with before you start working on MYR. W3Schools also has a great tutorial for
        familiarizing yourself with javascript that can be found here:

        GIT / GITHUB

    <p>
        Git is an open source distributed version control system. This lets you manage and
        Track changes made to a program or project. With git, everyone can have their own
        version of MYR saved locally to their machine, instead of having everyone work on
        the same code all at once. This allows us to work on individual features independently
        and add them to the master code without interference. Git is used almost everywhere
        that involves a collaborative codebase. Working with git can be unavoidable at times
        in the computer science field, so it's good to learn it early. A link to the git main
        page and documentation can be found here:
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/"> Git home page</a>
        <br><br>
        Github is a website that lets you host git projects for others to view and work on.
        All the code for MYR is available on github, and to begin working on it, you will have
        to make a copy of the MYR repository, hosted on github, to your machine. This will be
        explained later in the setting up development enviornment page. In the meantime, if
        you haven't made a github account, you should start now. Links to the github guide,
        and myr repositories can be found here:

        REACT

    <!---
    W3Schools also has a tutorial for react, easier to read and understand than reacts tutorial
    in my opinion. could be  used for onboarding instead.
